This is file is just a memo to build CHDK sd cards. Ignore it. Go to http://chdk.wikia.com/wiki/CHDK for detailed information.

The Spacebits LUA scripts can be found in the sub directories.

Bulding a SD card memo:

1. Open Disk Utility.
2. Select the card reader from the list of devices on the left.
3. Click the "Partition" tab in the right pane.
4. Select "2 Partitions" from the drop down list under "Volume Scheme"
5. Select and resize the first partition to 400 MB if you only intend to mainly use the CHDK partition.
6. Format this first partition as MS-DOS.
7. Select the second partition and format it as MS-DOS. The size will be set automatically.
7.5 Call the first partition BOOT and the second DATA
8. Click "Apply", then click "Partition" if prompted.
10. Select the first partition from the list on the left.
11. Get Info ( Apple+I ), and note the Disk Identifier, i.e. ( /dev/disk2s1 ).
12. Unmount the first partition. Do not eject.
13. You may also need to unmount the second partition. Do not eject.
14. Open the Terminal
15. Type: sudo newfs_msdos -F 16 -v BOOT -b 4096 -c 128 /dev/rdiskXsX. If you get the error "fdisk: /dev/diskX is not a character device or a regular file", you may need to instead refer to the disk as /dev/rdiskX
16. Type: fdisk -e /dev/rdiskX ie.( fdisk -e /dev/rdisk2 )
17. Ignore the error "fdisk: could not open MBR file ..."
18. Type: setpid 1
19. Enter 1 when prompted for new partition id.
20. Type: write
21. If you get the error "fdisk: /dev/diskX: Resource busy", you will need to go back to Disk Utility and unmount (but not eject) the second partition. Then redo the steps pertaining to the Terminal
22. Enter y if prompted
23. Type: exit
24. unzip the CHDK zip file to your sd card /BOOT partition. DO NOT USE OSX Finder unzipper, use the command line one.
25. the CHDK subdir goes to the DATA/ partition. The /BOOT partitions only needs  DISKBOOT.BIN and PS.FI2 to boot.
26. Very important: xattr -d com.apple.quarantine DISKBOOT.BIN PS.FI2 (in the BOOT partition of you SD CARD, see http://chdk.wikia.com/wiki/FAQ/Mac)
